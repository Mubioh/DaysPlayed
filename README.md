# DaysPlayed

DaysPlayed is a simple mod for Fabric that shows how many in game days you have played, just like in Minecraft Bedrock Edition.

Once installed, the number of Minecraft days since the world was created will appear on your screen. It updates automatically as time passes.

This is useful for tracking progress in long term survival worlds or hardcore runs.

### Requirements
- Fabric Loader
- Fabric API

Fabric API must be installed for the mod to work.

### Translations
